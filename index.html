<h2> KERALA</h2>
<p>The best way to discover the things to do in Kerala, is to immerse yourself in cultural encounters and explore the beautiful countryside. 
  The wealth of natural beauty in the form of placid backwaters, lush greenery, picturesque hill towns, and beautiful beaches has resulted in 
  the name ‘God’s Own Country. Munnar’s stunning tea plantations and Alappuzha’s serene backwaters make it into every list of what to see in Kerala.</p>
